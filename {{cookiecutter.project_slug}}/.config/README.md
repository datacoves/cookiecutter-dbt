# CONFIG FILE
This directory is configured to contain secrets.  You should not commit any files inside of this 
folder unless you really know what you're doing.  There are sample files that can be used as templates,
but your actual `profiles.yml` should not be committed _ever_ since it contains your username, password, and the hostname of our actual Snowflake instances. 

Keep your secrets secret.
